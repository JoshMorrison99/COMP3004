Add the ability for the app to get frequencies from the users microphone and convert those frequencies into note.

Added debug labels to the app, this will help determine what is going on when working with frequencies being picked up by the users microphone.

Add a noise gate to the note detection. The microphone will only read the frequencies from the mircophone only if the sound passes a certain threthold.

Added UI for the note detection. When a certain frequency is picked up from the microphone, the UI will display what note it is reading on the UI piano.

Started working on a tutorial on how to use the app.

Added the ability to hit notes in a certain order when the app displays the notes in a certain order.
